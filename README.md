Hello, today I am sharing my vehicle rental resource made in full NativeUI reloaded.

The authors are:
[https://github.com/iTexZoz/NativeUILua_Reloaded]
[https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended]
[https://github.com/kanersps/essentialmode]

You need to es_extended and essentialmode.

To install it:

start after es_extended and essentilmode.
NativeUI is already included in.
