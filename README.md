A simple modification for your script.

This fork just use the normal script without nativeui implemented, for less resource use and more ease of understanding.

If your goal was to implement it then I advise you to just create a branch with this version for those who do not want to add nativeui because they already have it.

For any request or question, here is my discord : Azeroth#8264

Have Fun
